# DiceSimulator
This is a dice simulator, where you can choose a fair die or a biased die. With a fair die, you only can choose the number of iterations. But with biased die, you can choose which number
in the range of 1-6 should have a biased probability, and what that probability is. Then you can enter the number of iterations that you want to see.
Thank You..
